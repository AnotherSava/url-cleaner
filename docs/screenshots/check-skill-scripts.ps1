  Checks that the screenshot capture scripts can still reach what they use from the docs-relevance skill in the
  dotfiles repo.

  The capture scripts borrow their machinery from that skill, so a fix there reaches every project that shoots
  screenshots. The cost is a dependency on paths and names the dotfiles repo can rename, and nothing else here
  reads them: the tests, the build and CI never run a capture, so a stale name goes unreported until someone
  next re-shoots a figure. A missing dot-sourced file fails before the capture touches anything, but a renamed
  function fails at its call, which for Invoke-WindowShot comes after the capture has moved the pointer and
  opened the window it came to photograph.

  Run from .claude/commit-checks.sh and not from CI, because the paths resolve under the developer's ~/.claude,
  which no runner has.

  Everything is read out of the capture scripts rather than listed here, so a new reference is checked from the
  commit that adds it. Each .ps1 under docs/screenshots/capture is checked on its own, and each problem line
  starts with its kind:
  - PARSE: the script does not parse. Its .claude/skills paths are still checked, nothing else in it is.
  - MISSING: a .claude/skills path written out whole anywhere in the script, comments included, or a file it
    dot-sources, does not exist.
  - UNREADABLE: a dot-source this check cannot turn into a file path, such as one built from a variable the
    script sets earlier, a relative path, or one starting with ~. The target expression is evaluated with
    $PSScriptRoot set to the script's folder.
  - LOAD: a script it dot-sources, or one of its own Add-Type calls, fails when run.
  - UNKNOWN: a command it calls is not a function it defines, a function from a script it dot-sources, or a
    command PowerShell finds.
  - PARAM: a named parameter it passes to a PowerShell function binds to none of that function's parameters.
  - TYPE, MEMBER: a [Type] does not resolve, or a [Type]::Member is not a public static member.
  - CRASH: checking the script failed outright, with the error that stopped it.
  A script that does not parse, or has a dot-source that is MISSING, UNREADABLE or fails to LOAD, has none of its
  names checked, since the functions and types that dot-source would add cannot be told from real unknowns.

  Each capture script is checked in a pwsh process of its own, because a type Add-Type defines stays loaded for
  the life of the process and would otherwise carry over from one script to the next. Inside that process its
  dot-sourced scripts run in a PowerShell instance of their own, with $ErrorActionPreference set to Stop as the
  capture scripts set it, so their top-level code executes but cannot reach this script's variables or
  functions. Types resolve in that instance, with the capture script's using statements and its own Add-Type
  calls applied. So a capture script loads every assembly whose types it names with an Add-Type of its own, even
  one a skill function it calls loads today: function bodies are never run here, and a capture that relies on
  one breaks when the skill stops loading it. A class or enum the script defines is taken as it is, and the
  other types in a literal that names one, such as List in [List[Shot]], are resolved one by one. A script with
  an Add-Type whose arguments are not constant gets no type checks, and the last line says so.

  Not checked: a script a skill function runs when called, such as window-shot.ps1, and the keys of the
  hashtable Invoke-WindowShot passes to it; the properties and methods of what a skill function returns, such
  as .Right on Get-PrimaryWorkArea's rectangle; variables a skill script sets; type names written as strings, as
  New-Object takes them; parameters passed to cmdlets or by splatting, a mandatory parameter a call leaves out,
  and how positional arguments bind; argument values, such as one a ValidateSet no longer lists; arguments
  passed on a dot-source line; and capture scripts in other languages.
